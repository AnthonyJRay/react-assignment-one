-1- Create "two new components"

- How to name the folders/files?

Component names "userInput" / "userOutput"
Include these into your main "App.js" file.

In the "userInput" component, add an "Input Element".
In the "userOutput" component, add "Two Paragraphs".
// add any text you want inside both paragraphs.

Then add both "input and output" components, in your "App.js".
// Use multiple userOutputs for now.
